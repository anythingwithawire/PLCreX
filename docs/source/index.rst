Welcome to PLCreX's documentation!
===================================

PLCreX is a modular CLI application for IEC 61131-3
`Programmable Logic Controllers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller>`_ (PLCs),
designed to support on topics such review, redesign, reuse, reliability, and much more (**reX**).

This project is motivated by our research and will be extended by further features step by step.
Together with integrated external tools, PLCreX represents a collection of numerous analysis and
reuse features for existing IEC 61131-3
`Program Organization Units <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_61131-3#Program_organization_unit_(POU)>`_ (POUs),
implemented in IEC 61131-3 Function Block Diagrams (FBDs) and Structured Text (ST).
